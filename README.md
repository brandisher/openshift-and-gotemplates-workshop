# OpenShift and Go Templates Workshop
A self-led workshop to demonstrate the power of go templates and how much fun you can have while using them with OpenShift!

## Prerequisites
* Access to an OpenShift cluster.  Some steps may require cluster-admin permissions.
* A project for the workshop.  We'll be using a project named `workshop` with the `httpd-example` template deployed, but you can use whatever project you'd like that has running workloads.
* `oc` in your `$PATH`
